# Joomla module WsaCarousel
Slider/Carousel based on  dj-imageslider and bootstrap carousel
DJ-imageslider of DJ-Extensions is fine slider module, but in horizontal transitions with more than slide visible the transition form end to start is not so nice, the description says also that a continuous loop not possible is. The bootstrap carrousel does with some exta CSS exactly what I  want, so I have made the output of this module more like the bootstrap carousel.
Copied from DJ-imageslider to give it a continuous loop

## Changelog

* 0.0 20180131 imported V3.2.3 of DJ-imageslider (https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/dj-imageslider/) by DJ-Extensions,
and renamed some files and reference.
* 0.0.9 For bootstrap 4 carousel changed in wsacarousel to make itindependent and to remove conflict in duration.  
* 0.2.0 For bootstrap 4 now using 4.3.1. In this version possibillity to change transition-duration is in standard so there is no need for own code to change this duration anymore. In 4.3.1 is also an option for individiual intervals per slide. I will implement this in one of the next versions of this module.
