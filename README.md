# Joomla module WsaCarousel
Slider/Carousel based on  dj-imageslider and bootstrap carousel
DJ-imageslider of DJ-Extensions is fine slider module, but in horizontal transitions with more than slide visible the transition form end to start is not so nice, the description says also that a continuous loop not possible is. The bootstrap carrousel does with some exta CSS exactly what I  want, so I have made the output of this module more like the bootstrap carousel.
Copied from DJ-imageslider to give it a continuous loop
